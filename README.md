# Traffic++
A WIP mod for Cities: Skylines to improve traffic.

# !!!ATTENTION!!!
This mod adds new components to the game which means maps saved while the mod is active won't work without it. You can run the mod in "Ghost Mode" (from its options screen in Content Manager > Mods) should you wish to load them without using Traffic++. In ghost modes the new components revert to their nearest native C:S equivalent, and all other Traffic++ funcitonailty is disabled.

# Objective
The goal of this mod is to improve traffic in Cities: Skylines by adding new roads, vehicles, tools and behaviours.

# Current Features

	- Six-lane road with bus lanes
	- Two-lane busway
	- Zonable pedestrian roads
	- Small gravel road
- Intersection lane editor

# Roadmap

- Many more...

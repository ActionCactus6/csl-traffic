# Traffic++
A WIP mod for Cities: Skylines to improve traffic.

# !!!ATTENTION!!!
This mod adds new components to the game which means that maps saved with this mod CANNOT be opened without it!
You don't need to start a new game to use this mod but you should backup your save file beforehand since this is a very early work in progress.

# Objective
The goal of this mod is to improve traffic in Cities: Skylines by adding new roads, vehicles, tools and behaviours.

# Current State
- Adds zonable pedestrian paths that can be used by public service vehicles, public transports and (optionally) commercial trucks;
- Adds a six-lane road with bus lanes

# Roadmap
- Different randomized vehicle speeds (already developed but not yet included)
- Allow info overlays to be active while building roads
- Add new types of roads and vehicles
- Many more...
